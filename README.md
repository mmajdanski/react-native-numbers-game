# Simple React-Native Todo

This is an extremely simple React-Native application that just shows a few of the built-in components in React-Native (with some custom components and styling added).

**The Game:** This is a very simple game where you enter in a Starting Number and then the computer guesses what your number is. You only give the computer the information of whether your number is higher/lower.

This is definitely an application for begginers to take a look at and understand a bit more about what can be accomplished with React-Native. You will see just how much you can build with these simple components that are built-in to React

- `<View>`
- `<Text>`
- `<StyleSheet>`
- `<Button>`

You will be surprised how much you can build with just those 4 components. From there, you can build your own more complex, styled components.

`npm start`
